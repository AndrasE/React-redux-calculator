## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I think the title is self-explanatory. 
This project was part of my self-study. If you go to the webapp and click on the logo you will find further details of this project, including challenges and particular solutions, tutorials and references; or just read the About.jsx in the repo. I hope you like it and it will offer you some help with your own project.

        to not just, but to hear the calculator. I felt that especially on
        mobile, it was a bit strange to not having any feedback (apart for the
